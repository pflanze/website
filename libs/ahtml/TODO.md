  * Add more documentation (both README and code docs), examples, code clean up.

  * The ahtml namespace is full of all-caps variables like `P`, split
    those vs. the rest into separate namespaces.

  * proc macro idea to add auto-propagation for Result::Err values?

  * Add `append` on `AVec`? (Every time I think I need it, I end up with
    code that doesn't.)
