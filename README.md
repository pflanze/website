# My website

This is the code that serves my website at `christianjaeger.ch`. It
also has the functionality to serve a blog, and has a preview for blog
posts with user logins.

It's a work in progress. YMMV. I might work to make this more
reusable, and publish a blog post about it.

## Installation

Note: I'm using older versions of dependencies (which I generally do
so that the code compiles with rustc from Debian stable, and to reduce
the risk from developer or server system breaches). The code
indirectly depends on ring 0.16.20, which looks like it might use
precompiled binaries, so I'm using `cargo vendor` and rebuild the
binaries in `ring` from source locally before building the
website. You could also `cargo update` instead and adapt the code if
necessary, since recent `ring` explicitly only uses precompiled
binaries on Windows. Or you could trust the systems where those
binaries were built, of course.

I have modified the `blake3` crate to use an older version of
`constant_time_eq` that compiles with rustc from Debian stable, and
`argon2` and `addr2line` to not require a newer rust-version than
Debian's compiler (which works just fine, but at least `argon2`
upstream doesn't want to apply the change). They are expected to be
checked out at `../src/`. So, run:

    cd ..
    mkdir src
    cd src
    git clone https://github.com/pflanze/BLAKE3
    git clone https://github.com/pflanze/password-hashes
    git clone https://github.com/pflanze/addr2line

These repositories, just like this one, carry Git tags signed by
me.

## Configuration

### `example`

Doesn't need anything, just connect to port 3000 on localhost.

### `website`

The `website` program reads a number of environment variables. E.g.:

    IS_DEV=1
    SESSIONID_HASHER_SECRET=$your_secret_string
    WELLKNOWNDIR=data/fallback/

These dirs need to exist (you could also use symlinks):

    mkdir data/{blog,preview}

The `accounts.db` sqlite database file needs to exist. Create via 

    sqlite3 accounts.db < accounts-schema.sql

Access to the `/preview` and `/fellowship` paths is restricted. Run
`cargo run --bin access_control -- --help` for how to create a group,
users, and adding the users to the group. As a minimum:

    cargo run --bin access_control -- create-group --group preview
    cargo run --bin access_control -- create-group --group fellowship

Then for each user:

    cargo run --bin access_control -- create-user --user foo
    cargo run --bin access_control -- add --group preview --user foo

There's currently no rate limiting, so use good passwords (it does
slow down each login attempt to take a second, though; hence the
minimum is about 56 bits of entropy).

Run the server via `cargo run --release --bin website`, it expects TLS
keys and to bind on low port numbers unless `IS_DEV=1` is set.
