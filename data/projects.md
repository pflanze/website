# Projects

## Websites in Rust

I have implemented this website in the programming language Rust, in
an extensible way so that I will be able to do other web projects
efficiently in that technology. I will publish the code and a blog
post soon.

## Teaching programming with C

[Cj50](https://github.com/pflanze/cj50) is a code base to help write
graphical programs (simple games) in the programming language C, in a
style that's reminiscent of the programming language Rust, i.e. more
modern, consistent, and in a way that should make learning Rust more
familiar. Perhaps this will also be useful for C programmers who would
like to start learning Rust?

## Data science & OpenStreetMap

Working with a scientist, I'm developing a code base in Rust to
evaluate [health data from
Brazil](https://github.com/climatehealthsim/brazildata). This also
includes the extraction of geographical data from OpenStreetMap. The
project is ongoing.

## Functional programming in Perl

[Functional Perl](http://functional-perl.org/) is a project to support
a functional programming style in Perl.
