# Work in a Climate context

I'm interested in working for projects in an environmental or climate
context.

I have a Master of Science degree in [Environmental
Sciences](https://usys.ethz.ch/en/studies/environmental-sciences.html)
from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). While I have much more
knowledge and experience as a software developer, this education can
help me understand what your company or project is working on, leading
to fewer misunderstandings and a more efficient collaboration.

I'm currently learning about and practising in the area of data
science and analytics to become productive in that area, too. <!--

My core interests and competencies are:

* Development of systems for data processing and management, as well
  as web sites and web- and GUI applications in the programming
  language
  [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)).
  Rust is a systems development language with advantages for
  performance, stability, and breadth of applicability.

* Development of systems for data processing or management as well as
  web sites in the programming language
  [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).

* Development and application of algorithms in either technology.

* Data science and analytics (easier cases or in collaboration, as I am still learning).

* Setup and maintenance of server infrastructure as needed.

I know enough about the JavaScript and TypeScript technologies to be
able to collaborate with people in the field (frontend and fullstack
development), but am not currently taking on projects as the main
developer in those technologies, except for scripting interactions
where necessary via [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and similar approaches
which reduce the complexity of frontend development.

I'm <!-- currently --> a member of the [Climatebase Fellowship](https://climatebase.org/fellowship).
